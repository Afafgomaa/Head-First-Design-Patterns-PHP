## MY-NOTES

### chapter 1:

* encapsulate what change and you will have flexible system.

* separate the code that will be changed.

* Program to an **interface** not an implementation : *an interface in this context could also refers to an abstract class or class that implements particular behavior*

* Represent the behavior of things and  not the thing.

* Think of behaviors as a set of algorithms.

* Composition over inheritance.
